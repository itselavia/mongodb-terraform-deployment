### Steps to Deploy
1. Clone this repository
2. Create KeyFile for Mongo Authentication
```bash
openssl rand -base64 756 > keyFile
```

3. cd into the repository
4. Edit the variables in the terraform.tfvars file
```hcl
  vpc_name = "mongo_vpc"
  replica_set_name = "mongoRs"
  num_secondary_nodes = 2
  mongo_username = "admin"
  mongo_password = "mongo4pass"
  mongo_database = "admin"
```
4. Set up the AWS CLI on your development machine and configure the ~/.aws/credentials file
```
  [default]
  aws_access_key_id = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  aws_secret_access_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
5. Install [Terraform] on your development machine

[Terraform]: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

6. Use "terraform init" to initialize the modules

7. Use "terraform plan" to view the resources that would be created

8. Use "terraform apply" to deploy the cluster
